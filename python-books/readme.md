# 📚 Python Books — Curated Reading Guide

A practical, opinionated list of **Python books** to take you from beginner → advanced, with tracks for web, data, DevOps, testing, and architecture. Use it as a README in your repo or as a personal study plan.

---

## 🎯 Who this is for
- Developers starting with Python or returning to it.
- Engineers aiming to level up in **backend**, **data**, or **DevOps**.
- Teams that want a shared, structured reading plan.

---

## 🧭 How to use this README
1. Pick a **track** below (Core, Web, Data, DevOps, Testing, Architecture).
2. Follow the **Quick Path** if you want a fast start, otherwise use the **Core Curriculum**.
3. Check off items as you finish ✅.
4. Keep notes in `/notes/<book>.md` and add your own highlights.

> Tip: 45–60 minutes/day is enough to finish 1–2 solid books per month.
